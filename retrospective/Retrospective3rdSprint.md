TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 4 committed vs 4 done
- Total points committed vs done : 21 committed vs 21 done
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) : 96h planned vs 96h28m spent

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Integration Test passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed
- All tasks are in "Done" state


### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|--------:|-------:|-----------:|-------------:|
| _Uncategorized_ | 16 | - | 33h20m | 34h25m |
| PT24  | 9       | 3 | 9h40m | 10h55m |
| PT25 | 11 | 8 | 20h10m | 18h45m |
| PT26 | 10 | 5 | 16h10m | 15h43m |
| PT27 | 11 | 5 | 16h40m | 16h40m |
| **Total** | 57 | 21 | **96** | **96h28m** |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
