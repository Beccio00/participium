TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done :
- Total points committed vs done :
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) :

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Integration Test passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed
- All tasks are in "Done" state


### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|--------:|-------:|-----------:|-------------:|
| _Uncategorized_ | 16 | - | 33h20m | 34h25m |
| Assign  | 12 | 5 | 13h05m | 13h50m |
| Report approval and rejection | 8 | 1 | 8h35m | 8h45m |
| Report display on the map | 6 | 5 | 5h25m | 5h16m |
| Report assign overview | 8 | 2 | 10h05m | 10h05m |
| User account customization | 9 | 3 | 9h35m | 9h50m |
| Update report | 10 | 8 | 13h35m | 12h10m | 
we did not manage to finish the implementation of this story 
| **Total** | 67 | 24 | **96h** | **95h06m** |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 7h55m
  - Total hours spent: 7h55m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 599
  - Coverage (if available): 
    - Statements: 84.25 %
    - Branches: 72.33 %
    - Functions: 71.09 %
    - Lines: 83.85 %
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 7h55m
  - Total hours spent: 8h5m
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h
  - Total hours spent: 4h25m
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated: 15h
  - Total hours spent: 13h25m
- Technical Debt management
  - Strategy adopted: We aimed to bring our codebase closer to the established quality standards. We successfully maintained this approach up to Sprint 2. For Sprint 3, however, the code quality ended up slightly above the expected technical debt threshold.
  - Total hours estimated at sprint planning: 3h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
